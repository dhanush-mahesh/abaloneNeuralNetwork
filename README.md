Neural Network Model for Abalone Data
This Python code is designed to train and evaluate neural network models on the Abalone dataset. The Abalone dataset contains information about the age of abalones based on various physical attributes.

Requirements
To run this code on your machine, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn (for train_test_split and mean_squared_error)
scikit-learn (for MLPRegressor for building the neural network)
You can install these libraries using pip by running the following commands:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dataset file. The code expects a CSV file with the data. You can change the data source by modifying the data_file parameter in the NeuralNet constructor in the __main__ block. Ensure that the path points to a location accessible from your machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Run the code by executing the Python script:

bash
python abaloneNeuralNetwork.py

The code will perform the following steps:
- Load and preprocess the dataset, which includes handling null values, ensuring data integrity, and standardizing attributes.
- Train multiple neural network models with various hyperparameter combinations, including different activation functions, learning rates, maximum iterations, and the number of hidden layers.
- For each model, it keeps track of model history, including the loss curve (performance vs. the number of epochs), and plots these curves for comparison.
- Outputs a table of results showing the hyperparameters, training and test accuracies, and training and test errors (mean squared error).

The results will be displayed in the console, and loss curves for different hyperparameter combinations will be saved in the plot.

Note: The code provided in the NeuralNet class performs the necessary data preprocessing and training of neural network models based on the specified hyperparameters. You can customize the hyperparameter search space and other parameters according to your specific requirements.
